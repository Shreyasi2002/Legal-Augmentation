It has been received by the respondent that the appellant herein is in fact a defaulter for the last number of years and that he has been living in dignity as a human being as possible.</FAC><FAC>The respondent is suffering from serious ill-treatment.</FAC><FAC>The appellant has been held not guilty for five of the six years under which he was in custody but acquitted for the remaining period of five years.</FAC><FAC>Thereafter, the appellant has been very much pleased with the conduct of the respondent and has been very much pleased with the fact that he has settled down and is running his own business.</FAC><FAC>He has not been in very much of a state of mind as had been the appellant prior to the incident.</FAC><FAC>He is a young, unfortunate man who has escaped from a very bad situation.</FAC><FAC>The family relationship between the appellant and the respondent is very much cordial one.</FAC><FAC>The appellant is a well-wisher of the family and has taken part in charitable giving, running his own course of business and having his own affairs.</FAC><FAC>It is not his case that he has been feeding his family solely by purchasing old potatoes from the field of the potatoes growers and turning into the industry he has become a well-wisher of the family and has certainly maintained a close relation with the respondent.</FAC><FAC>The appellant has certainly looked after himself well and has taken part in many charitable giving events.</FAC><FAC>Hence it is not his case that he has been keeping his distance and taking part in many type of activities.</FAC><FAC>The fact remains that the appellant has also been very much content with his past conduct and has been very much content with the present case.</FAC><FAC>This Court is of the view that there is no evidence to show that the appellant has been directing the present proceeding in a bad manner.</FAC><FAC>The allegations made in this case have been fairly dealt with.</FAC><FAC>There is nothing in the record to show that this Court has considered the question of whether the appellant had any ulterior motive or had any intention to injure the respondent.</FAC><FAC>The case of Bodu Roy Krishna Reddy is no different and Bodu Roy Krishna Reddy is a different person.</FAC><FAC>The ulterior motive has to be viewed in the light of the circumstances of this case.</FAC><FAC>It is not possible to hold in this case that on the date 27.1.1995 at about 11.30 A.M the appellant did not know the deceased.</FAC><FAC>It is also not possible to hold at the time of incident that the appellant was in a position to have known about the condition of the other persons in the house when the incident took place.</FAC><FAC>The prosecution has tried to explain away the presence of the appellant in the house by putting a barrier around him, but it cannot explain away the presence of the appellant in the house.</FAC><FAC>The prosecution has failed to explain away the presence of the appellant in the house by putting a barrier around him.</FAC><FAC>It is also important to keep in mind that all these factors are there together to explain the presence of the appellant in the house.</FAC><FAC>It is not possible to conduct post mortem examination on a person post mortem examination on the body.</FAC><FAC>The post mortem examination and the post mortem examination are different and there is nothing in the record to show that the post mortem examination and the inquest are different in any manner.</FAC><ANALYSIS> 3. The prosecution has not proved that the appellant has given the information to the police through telephone, by telling the police inspector, by the doctor and by any other person.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>There is no evidence to show that the appellant made the obscene language in the house, as alleged or not.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>It is not in dispute that the house belongs to the accused.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>The appellant is the owner of rare and valuable property.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>He has often made obscene and false statements in the past.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>He has no need to now.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS> 4. The prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant made obscene and false statement implicating the deceased.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>The prosecution has proved that the appellant made the statement before the Inspector of the police, by writing down the name and address of the person to whom he has given the information.</ANALYSIS><ANALYSIS>The statement was sufficient to prove that the person who gave the information was a neighbour.</ANALYSIS><RATIO> 5. In view of the above discussed evidence and the fact that the appellant has been convicted in a previous life threatening death to the appellant, it is necessary to consider whether in the facts and circumstances of the present case the death of the deceased might have been prevented or prevented by the prosecution.</RATIO><RATIO>As there is no evidence to show that the appellant has committed murder of his own sister, the murder having been committed by the appellant, it cannot be said that the murder case is 100% safe and that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the culpability of the appellant in such a case.</RATIO><RATIO>If the prosecution proposes to prove the commission of murder, it must base its case on evidence which is not there.</RATIO><RATIO>In the present case, there is not sufficient evidence to connect the appellant with the commission of the crime, as there is a gap in the evidence on which the prosecution proposes to rely.</RATIO><RPC> 6. In the result, the appellant deserves to be acquitted.</RPC><RPC>The accused is entitled for the acquittal.</RPC><RPC>The impugned judgment and order of conviction passed by the trial Court is set aside.</RPC><RPC>The accused is entitled to the appropriate punishment.</RPC><RPC> The surety of the appellant deserves to be preserved as a primary concern of the offender and to the court.</RPC><RPC>The surety of the respondent deserves to enjoy the benefits of the Probation of Offenders Act.</RPC><RPC>The accused deserves to be set at liberty forthwith and to surrender himself to his bail bonds.</RPC><RPC>The bail bond passed by the accused deserves to be destroyed.</RPC><NONE>.............................................J. </NONE><NONE>[ R.
